# g5kapi

This application is in charge of providing the core APIs for Grid'5000.

The project is hosted at <https://github.com/grid5000/g5kapi>.

Please send an email to <support-staff@lists.grid5000.fr> if you cannot access the code,
but if you read this, it's normally goodâ€¦

## Installation

The app is packaged for Debian Wheezy. Therefore installation is as follows:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install g5k-api

In particular, runtime dependencies of the app include `ruby1.9.3` and `git-core`.


## Development

### Development environment

* This app comes with a Vagrant box used for development, testing and packaging. 
  For users with a working installation of vagrant and virtualbox, setting up a 
  working environement starts with a simple

        $ vagrant up --provision
        $ vagrant ssh
        vagrant> cd /vagrant
        vagrant> bundle install 

  The vagrant provisionning script will attempt to configure the VM's root and vagrant
  accounts to be accessible by ssh. By default, it will copy your authorized_keys, but you 
  can control the keypair used with SSH_KEY=filename_of_private_key  

  Of course, reality is a bit more complex. You might have troubles with the insecure
  certificate of the vagrant box provider. In that case, you'll need to start with 

        $ vagrant box add --insecure --name debian-wheezy-x64-puppet_3.0.1 \
          https://vagrant.irisa.fr/boxes/debian-wheezy-x64-puppet_3.0.1.box

  And as the application relies on external data sources, you'll need to connect
  it with a reference-repository, an OAR database, a kadeploy3 server, and a jabber server
  to exercice all its functionnality, in addition to its own backend services that
  are already packaged in the Vagrant box. As this is not trivial a requires some compromises,
  the development of this application relies strongly on unit tests. 
 
* For those of you that prefer working with the more classical rvm approach, you'll 
  need 
  
  * a working installation of `ruby` 1.9.3. We recommend using `rvm` to manage your ruby
  installations.
  
  * As with every Rails app, it uses the `bundler` gem to manage dependencies:
  
        $ gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
  
  Note: in the next sections we'll run `rake` or `cap` executables. If you're
  using an old version of bundler and are not using `rvm` to manage your ruby
  installations, you will probably need to prefix every executable with
  `bundle exec`. E.g. `rake -T` will become `bundle exec rake -T`.
  
  * From the application root, install the application dependencies,
  For nokogiri see
  [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html):

        $ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev  # needed for the mysql2 gem
        $ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev           # needed for the pg gem
        $ bundle install
  
  * [option1 - the hard way - setup the full development environment on your machine]
  
  Install a MySQL database, and any other dependency that can be required by
  the API to run, and adapt the configuration files located in
  `config/options/`. Look at the puppet recipes that can be found in the
  `puppet/` directory to know more about the software that should be installed
  to mirror the production servers.
  
  * [option2 - the old way - use a Grid'5000 node as your development server]
  
  If you don't want to install a mysql server and other dependencies on your
  machine, you can use one of the Capistrano tasks that are bundled with the
  app to install the full development environment on a Grid'5000 node. If you
  enter the following command, then you'll have a Grid'5000 node provisioned
  for you with the right version of the OS and all the software dependencies
  and port forwarding setup (takes about 5-10 minutes to deploy and
  configure):
  
        $ SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/id_rsa_accessg5k HOST=graphene-29.nancy.g5k cap develop
        $ SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/id_rsa_accessg5k HOST=graphene-29.nancy.g5k cap package
        $ SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/id_rsa_accessg5k HOST=graphene-29.nancy.g5k cap install
        $ ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 graphene-29.nancy.g5k
        $ http://localhost:8000/ui/dashboard
  
  This used to be the recommended approach, and you can reuse the node for packaging a
  new release once you've made some changes. It is no longer actively maintained, but
  kept here for reference if vagrant and virtualbox are a difficult setting for you

### Development environment's access to data

* Setup the database schema:

        vagrant> rake db:setup RAILS_ENV=development

* Give access to reference data to expose. The scripts expect you
  have a checkout version of the reference-repository in a sibling directory
  to this code.  

        (g5k-api) $ cd ..
				( ) $ git clone ssh://g5kadmin@git.grid5000.fr/srv/git/repos/reference-repository.git \
              reference-repository
  
  You might not have admin access to Grid'5000's reference repository. in this case, you 
  could duplicate the fake repository used for tests, in the spec/fixtures/reference-repository
  directory. 

        (g5k-api) $ cp -r spec/fixtures/reference-repository ..
        (g5k-api) $ mv ../reference-repository/git.rename ../reference-repository/.git

  Do not attempt to use the directory directly, as unit test play with the git.rename dir.

* Get access to a OAR database
  
  * Get your hands on a copy of an active database
   
        $ ssh oardb.reims.g5kadmin sudo cat /var/backups/all_db.sql.gz > all_db.sql.gz
        $ gunzip all_db.sqp
        vagrant>SEED=all_db.sqp RAILS_ENV=development rake db:oar:seed
  
  * Or tunnel your way to a live database (as g5k-api only requires read-only access)
    This is particularly usefull if you want to develop on the UI (but with bad site 
    information). You should setup an SSH tunnel between your machine and one of the 
    oardb servers of Grid'5000, so that you can access the current jobs:

        $ #first create a reverse port from the vagrant machine to 
		    $ #your own machine
        $ vagrant ssh -- -R 15433:localhost:15433

				$ In an other shell, create a tunnel from your machine to Grid'5000 
        $ ssh -NL 15433:oardb.rennes.grid5000.fr:5432 access.grid5000.fr

				# finally, edit the development section of app/config/defaults.yml to 
				  oar:
					    <<: *oar
							host: 127.0.0.1
							port: 15433
							username: oarreader
							password: read
							database: oar2
				

### Wrapping it up to run the server

* To run the server, just enter:

        $ ./bin/g5k-api server start -e development

* If you need to be authenticated for some development, use:

        $ HTTP_X_API_USER_CN=dmargery ./bin/g5k-api server start -e development

* If you want to develop on the UI, run your browser on 
        
				$ firefox http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui

That's it. If you're not too familiar with `rails` 3, have a look at
<http://guides.rubyonrails.org/>.

You can also list the available rake tasks and capistrano tasks to see what's
already automated for you:

    $ rake -T
    $ cap -T


## Testing

Assuming you have your development environment setup, the only missing step is
to create a test database, and a fake OAR database.

* Create the test database as follows:

        $ RAILS_ENV=test rake db:setup

* Create the fake OAR database as follows:

        $ RAILS_ENV=test rake db:oar:seed

* Launch the tests:

        $ RAILS_ENV=test rspec spec/ # or `bundle exec autotest` if rake fails (issue with Rails<3.1 and em_mysql2 adapter with evented code).


## Packaging

* Bumping the version number is done as follows (a new changelog entry is
  automatically generated in `debian/changelog`):

        $ rake package:bump:patch # or: package:bump:minor, package:bump:major

* Building the `.deb` package is easy, since we kindly provide a `capistrano`
  recipe that will automatically reserve a machine on Grid'5000, deploy a
  squeeze-based image, upload the latest committed code (`HEAD`) in the
  current branch, generate a `.deb` package, and download the generated
  package back to your machine, in the `pkg/` directory.

  Just execute:

        $ cap package

  You can also pass a specific HOST if you wish (in this case it won't reserve
  a node on Grid'5000):

        $ cap package HOST=...
        $ cap package HOST=griffon-71.nancy.user SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/id_userg5k

  With vagrant (copy your ssh public key into the root account of the VM if
  the automated vagrant provisioning script hasn't (see higher)):

        $ cap package HOST=root@192.168.2.10 NOPROXY=true
        $ cap package USE_VAGRANT=true NOPROXY=true

## Releasing and Installing and new version

* Once you've packaged the new version, you must release it to the APT
  repository hosted on apt.grid5000.fr. There is Capistrano task for this:
  By default it will release to g5k-api-devel repository hosted by apt.grid5000.fr

        $ REMOTE_USER=g5kadmin cap release

  The system does not support different keys for the gateway and the remote node.
  In this case, the following might work for you

        $ SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/id_rsa_grid5000_g5k NOPROXY=true REMOTE_USER=g5kadmin cap release

  Note that you can use the same task to release on a different host (for
  testing purposes for example), by setting the HOST environment variable to
  another server (a Grid'5000 node for instance).

  To release to stable API, you will need to set PROD_REPO before running the task

	$ REMOTE_USER=g5kadmin PROD_REPO=true cap release

* If you released on apt.grid5000.fr, then you are now able to install the new
  version on any server by launching the following commands:
  	  
	puppet-repo $ cap cmd HOST="api-server-devel.[sites]" CMD='sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold" g5k-api'
        
  A more flexible mechanism can be used base on the script/puppet-repo-custom.rb file

	puppet-repo $ bundle exec cap shell ROLES=devel
        cap> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install g5k-api -y && sudo puppetd -t

  For this command to work, you should have a look in the
  `script/puppet-repo-custom.rb` file, which in my case was dropped into the
  `config/` directory of the `puppet-repo` repository.

  Then you can check that every server has the correct version running by
  grepping through the processlist to check the version numbers:

        puppet-repo $ bundle exec cap shell ROLES=devel
        cap> ps aux | grep g5k-api | grep -v grep

## Maintenance

* <https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/API_Maintenance>;

* There exist monit recipes that send emails when an alert is raised. At the
  time of writing (2011-10-18), these alerts are sent to
  <cyril.rohr@irisa.fr>. You might want to change that.

## Kadeploy update process

Since Kadeploy3 uses DRb to communicate with clients, and that a lot of code is
shared between the client and server, clients must have the whole kadeploy3 code
accessible. So, each time a new version of Kadeploy is released and installed on
the Grid5000 sites, you MUST remember to update the kadeploy-common package.
